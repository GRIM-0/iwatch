Don Cash and Bill Harmon of the Cash Harmon Television production company, produced the series for Network Ten, which requested a Coronation Street-type serial, and specifically one that explored adult subjects. The premise, original story outlines, and the original characters were devised by David Sale who also wrote the scripts for the first episodes and continued as script editor for much of the show's run. The series proved to be a huge success, running from 1972 until 1977. Number 96 was so popular it spawned a feature film version, filmed in December 1973. Number 96 was known for its sex scenes and nudity, somewhat risque at the time, and for its comedy characters. The series was the first Australian soap opera to feature an openly gay character.","poster_path":"/hlzQDQAVfzjPLmJmLm9UJPGPSV6.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"original_language":"en","genre_ids":[35,80,18],"popularity":156.756,"first_air_date":"1972-03-13","vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":5,"origin_country":["AU"]},{"backdrop_path":null,"id":1405096,"title":"Psychic Darkness Video 96","original_title":"心霊闇動画96","overview":"The 96th installment and collection of horror videos that carefully select and introduce psychic images that are being born from darkness and are about to be buried in the darkness!","poster_path":"/neyGpW6jpBjQQrwfx3SIrVbEeXD.jpg","media_type":"movie","adult":false,"original_language":"ja","genre_ids":[27],"popularity":0.767,"release_date":"2025-02-05","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"backdrop_path":"/30PPkOutleHaBLS6qUfT7HuY107.jpg","id":12302,"name":"Class of '96","original_name":"Class of '96","overview":"Class of '96 is an American drama series that aired on Fox from January to May 1993.

The international success of the film Das Boot made the U-96, of which it fictionally recounts the 7th combat patrol at sea, the most famous of all Hitler's submarines and arguably one of the most famous movie submarines. But the true story of this extraordinary submarine and its equally exceptional crew goes far beyond fiction. Knowing that the success of Das Boot not only opened the doors of Hollywood to Wolfgang Petersen, but also made this film an absolute reference from which all submarine warfare films produced by American cinema were subsequently inspired, this opens ultimately the way to a broader reflection on the indirect, even unconscious relationship that exists between the power of the images of Hitler's propaganda and that of today's Hollywood cinema.","poster_path":"/gHylSjrPIkxLIzJq3LobYdMN7N2.jpg","media_type":"movie","adult":false,"original_language":"fr","genre_ids":[99,36,10770],"popularity":0.904,"release_date":"2023-08-24","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2},{"backdrop_path":null,"id":235311,"title":"Toruko maruhi saizensen: Mitsugi 96 te","original_title":"トルコ（秘）最前線　密技９６手","overview":"Tamaki is reunited with her wayward brother Yoichi when he rescues her from a gang-bang by three hoodlums.
